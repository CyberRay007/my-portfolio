# My Portfolio

As a dedicated Network Technician and Cybersecurity Professional, I specialize in building secure, resilient IT infrastructures that keep organizations connected, protected, and productive.
Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the National Open University of Nigeria, combining academic knowledge with real-world technical training. I hold certifications in Networking from Cisco and Alison, and I'm currently advancing my skills through a Cybersecurity course with Cisco, focusing on threat detection, secure network architecture, and proactive defense strategies.
Alongside my core expertise in networking and security, I also have a background in HTML, CSS, and Python, which enhances my ability to understand application structures, support front-end functionality, and script automated solutions when needed.
I have a strong foundation in network troubleshooting, firewall management, endpoint security, and threat analysis-skills that help me safeguard both data and connectivity.
My goal is simple: ensure seamless operations while proactively defending against digital threats. Currently seeking to grow within a forward-thinking organization where I can apply my technical expertise, contribute to robust IT strategies, and evolve as a leader in cybersecurity and network management.
